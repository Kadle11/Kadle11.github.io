 I am a CS Ph.D. Student at Georgia Tech specializing in Computing Systems. 
 I am interested in research regarding Distributed Systems/Operating Systems, specifically in
 improving resource utilization efficiency and reducing network communication overheads for datacenter workloads.

 I am currently a part of the Kernel Research Group at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. Ada Gavrilovska.
 Prior to pursuing my M.S at Georgia Tech, I worked at the GeForce Now team @Nvidia and the 
 Server Performance Team @ AMD.
